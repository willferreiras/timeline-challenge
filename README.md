# Timeline Challenge - By Willian Santos

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Challenge time spent

I took just over 4 hours to complete the challenge. I would like to highlight a break in the middle of the process to address personal issues.

## Details of the project

I adopted a framework where there would be an initial data state and could add more if desired. I divided the project into components with well-defined functionalities. The timeline separates events by start and end dates, respecting items with overlapping dates. I would also have liked to implement a sorting function, but it would have exceeded the final deadline by too much..

## Strength of the project

What I liked most about the project was the possibility of inserting new data, in addition to the initial ones provided for the challenge..

## If i do the challenge again

With more time:

- Add drag and drop functionality;
- Order functionality.
- Implementing a mobile view.

## About the design

Seeking to develop a layout based on timelines that I already know (such as Google Calendar), using bright and random colors to differentiate created events
